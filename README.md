My name is Dylan Villarreal Toscano, a highly motivated software developer currently working as a Software Engineer at Irwin Research & Development. In my role, I utilize tools such as Visual Studio, C#, C++, .NET Framework, and Windows Forms to develop and maintain software solutions.

I graduated in July 2023 from the University of Colima, where I earned my degree in Software Engineering from the Faculty of Telematics. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have built a solid foundation in software development, honing my skills through hands-on projects and diverse experiences.

During my time at HMH Sistemas in Colima, where I worked for 1 year and 7 months while studying, I specialized in React and Vue technologies. I gained valuable experience developing web and mobile applications using React Native, and I believe that following best practices is crucial to producing high-quality code. I take pride in delivering clean, efficient, and maintainable solutions.

In addition to my technical expertise, I possess essential soft skills that make a well-rounded software developer. Effective communication, problem-solving, time management, attention to detail, and teamwork are skills that I consistently apply in my work.

I am a quick learner, a dedicated worker, and a team player. My experience and skill set make me a valuable asset to any team, and I am always eager to learn, grow, and contribute.
