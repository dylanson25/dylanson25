My name is **Dylan Villarreal Toscano**, I am a highly motivated software developer with outstanding skills in frontend development. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have gained a solid foundation in software development and have been able to hone my skills through real-world projects and experiences.

I specialize in technologies such as React and Vue, and have experience in developing web and mobile applications using react-native. I believe that following best practices is key to producing high-quality code, and I take pride in delivering clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I enjoy working in a team environment, where I can share my ideas, learn from others, and collaborate to achieve common goals.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess soft skills that are essential for software developers. Communication, problem-solving, time management, attention to detail, and teamwork are just some of the skills that I possess and have applied in the projects I have worked on.

Overall, I am a quick learner, a hard worker, and a team player. My experience and skills make me an asset to any team, and I am always eager to learn and grow.
